To run the docker container, make sure the docker daemon is running.
For example, on Arch Linux:

  systemctl status docker

Starting (running) the container
--------------------------------

To start the docker container, run:

  docker-compose -f docker-arch.yaml up -d

To see what it is being printed, run:

  docker-compose -f docker-arch.yaml logs -f

The sudo command is added by entrypoint.sh.
All required packages are added by user-entrypoint.sh.

Running a shell in the container
--------------------------------

To run a shell inside the running container:

  docker exec -it machine-learning su --login --whitelist-environment=DISPLAY,GITACHE_ROOT,AUTOGEN_CMAKE_ONLY,TensorflowCC_DIR,TENSORFLOW_PREFIX archuser

This puts you in /home/archuser
Note that only data added to / changes made to files in the directory ~/data are persistent!

Destroying the container
------------------------

To destroy all of the above again (execpt what you did in ~/data):

  docker-compose -f docker-arch.yaml down

---

To see which containers exist / are running:

  docker ps --all

To remove a container that isn't running anymore:

  docker rm ID

or simply

  docker rm machine-learning
